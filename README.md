#### 1.) Calculate a rectangle’s area and perimeter
  ##### Operation
The application prompts the user to enter values for the length and width of a rectangle.
The application displays the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
The application prompts the user to continue.

  ##### Specifications
The formulas for calculating area are perimeter are:
area = width * length
perimeter = 2 * width + 2 * length
The application should accept decimal entries like 10.5 and 20.65.
Assume that the user will enter valid numeric data for the length and width.
The application should continue only if the user enters “y” or “Y” to continue.

#### 2) Convert number grades to letter grades

  ##### Operation
The user enters a numerical grade from 0 to 100.
The application displays the corresponding letter grade.
The application prompts the user to continue.

  ##### Specifications
Assume that the user will enter valid integers for the grades.
The application should continue only if the user enters “y” or “Y” to continue.
The grading criteria is as follows:

A 88-100
B 80-87
C 67-79
D 60-66
F <60

#### 3) Create an application that asks the user to enter a file size in megabytes (MB) and then calculates how long it takes to download that file with a 56k analog modem. To do the calculations, assume that a 56K modem can transfer data at the rate of 5.2 kilobytes (KB) per second.

#### 4.) Write an application that displays a solid square (the same number of rows and columns) of asterisks whose side length is specified in integer parameter side.
